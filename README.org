** Lecture Information

- *WARNING:* This is the content only covered by me as this lecture is shared by
  both me and Prof. Bernhard Hollaus, Ph.D.
- The goal of this lecture is to introduce to you the interesting world of machine
  design/control. The content is relatively math heavy but there are
  quite some simulations to give a better picture on how machines operate
  and are controlled.
- Simulation are done via MATLAB and SIMULINK and therefore
  to get the most out of the lecture, it is recommended for students to download
  and install these software(s).

The structure for this lecture is as follows.
