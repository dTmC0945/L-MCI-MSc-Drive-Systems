** Lecture Information

*WARNING:* This is the content only covered by me as this lecture is shared by
both me and Prof. Bernhard Hollaus, Ph.D.

The goal of this lecture is to introduce to you the interesting world of machine
design/control. The content is relatively math heavy but there are
quite some simulations to give a better picture on how machines operate
and are controlled. Simulation are done via MATLAB and SIMULINK and therefore
to get the most out of the lecture, it is recommended for students to download
and install these software(s).

The Lecture structure for this lecture is as follows.
